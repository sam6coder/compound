# compound

This program is designed in C++ provides first and second largest compounded words. The algorithm provided here uses tries to store all words and then check if the word  have any prefix  from the given input file . If the input string contains any prefix then it add the input string and suffix to stl multimap. Vector longestStr contains the key strings which contains compounded words. After building the trie and the multimap, then we start processing the multimap by popping a pair from the beginning. As explained above, the pair contains the original word and the suffix we want to validate. We check whether the suffix is a valid or compound word. If itâ€™s a valid word and the original word is the longest up to now, we store the result. Otherwise we discard the pair. The suffix may be a compound word itself, so we check if the it has any prefixes. If it does, then we apply the above procedure by adding the original word and the new suffix to the queue. If the suffix of the original popped pair is neither a valid word nor has a prefix, we simply discard that pair.
